Use the MCP server to take a look at the 'sample_mflix', specifically at the 'movies' collection. 
Build a well-formed MEAN stack application that for now has 3 pages. Page 1 is the root home page
that lists the alphabet. When the user clicks on a letter it takes them to Page 2, which shows a
subset of the movies that begin with that letter on well organized cards displaying 15 movies at a time.
When the user clicks on a card, it takes them to Page 3, which shows all the information associated 
with a movie. Make this site pleasant to work with and use the same color scheme as mongodb.com. 
The code should be well organized with front end and back end code in different folders.
When having the code connect to MongoDB Atlas, use the connection string in the root .env file.
